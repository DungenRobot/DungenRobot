## Howdy!

I'm a college student pursuing game design and computer science. I use `he/him` pronouns and the Godot game engine.

I'm learning Rust, C, and C++. 

### Finished Projects
- All my games are on [my itch.io page](https://dungenrobot.itch.io/)
- [My solutions for Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/DungenRobot/advent-of-code-2023)
- [An assembler for the hack assembly language](https://github.com/DungenRobot/hack-assembler)
- [My Raytracing in a weekend in Java](https://github.com/DungenRobot/java-raytracer) (not fully complete but my project files started being silly and broke)
- [A basic text adventure engine](https://github.com/DungenRobot/text-adventure-engine)

### In Progress
- Working through Advent of Code 2024!
- A time-traveling point and click adventure game
- An extension for Godot that implements Rust's [Chrono](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/) library and IANA timezones.
- A (basic) VR social game with voice chat and worlds!
- A big 'ol space game
